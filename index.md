This is a [MoneyButton](https://www.moneybutton.com/).

<div class="money-button"
  data-to="363"
  data-amount=".2"
  data-currency="USD"
  data-label="for great good"
  data-hide-amount="undefined"
  data-client-identifier="629ca05d51fa1f00064c8c5ad08855cc"
  data-button-id="1537751432581"
  data-button-data="{}"
  data-type="tip"
></div>

- It takes about one minute to make.
- You can accept tips or payments for your products from anyone in the world.
- Only you have access to your money. The people who make MoneyButton do not.
- Small amounts are not a problem because it is based on [Bitcoin Cash](https://bitcoincashers.org/).
- There are [other ways to send](https://bitcoincashers.org/resources/wallets/), but this is the fastest and easiest way on the web.
